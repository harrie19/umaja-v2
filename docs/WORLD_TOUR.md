🧵 THREAD: How I built a €0-budget AI business with ethics baked in

1/ Most startups need €50k minimum. I had €0.
But I had GitHub Copilot, GaiaNet credits, and an idea...

2/ The concept: Autonomous AI agents generate revenue
But 19% automatically goes to humanitarian causes
Inspired by Bahá'í principles (Huququ'lláh)

3/ Meet the team:
- Trevor: Content generation agent
- Nigel: Affiliate marketing automation (coming)
- Percival: Trading bot (planned)

4/ The twist: They have personalities
Trevor talks like John Cleese
Because why should AI be boring?

5/ Tech stack (all FREE):
- GitHub (hosting)
- Supabase (database)
- Vercel (deployment)
- GaiaNet (AI inference)
- PayPal (payouts)

[FULL THREAD WITH SCREENSHOTS]

Final: This is what ethical AI looks like
Not just "don't be evil"
But "actively do good"

Subject: Ethical AI Story - Built €0-budget autonomous income system

Hi [Name],

I built an AI system that generates passive income and automatically 
donates 19% to charity - with zero startup capital.

Unusual angles:
- Coded by GitHub Copilot (meta: AI building AI)
- John Cleese personality layer (dry British wit)
- Bahá'í ethics as core architecture
- 100% transparent finances

Built in public: github.com/harrie19/umaja-v2

Would this resonate with your audience?

Best,
Marek
